I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

There are many places in the immediate area that will give you more bang for your buck let alone a more professional staff to deal with.\\n   I write this review because of my extreme dissatisfaction with this complex. Upon moving here there was an all-star team in the office in regards to leasing, management and maintenance. Just over 6 months ago there was an extreme shift in the staff and I have never experienced such a lack of compassion, lack of urgency, and general abrasiveness from a team in my life.\\n   For one, on a general scale the quality of tenant's has decreased at an alarming rate. In the time that I've lived here in a top floor unit I have experienced a man that beat his wife multiple times, and have complained to the office to take action multiple times with a modest amount of action from them at best and a completely casual reaction. I have also lived above what can only clearly be described as a drug dealer's stash house, that reeked of weed, had violent arguments erupt at all times of the day, and drug deals at all times of the night. Besides my \\\"high quality\\\" neighbors, there is an unruly amount of middle school to high school kids that are clearly up to no good and basically terrorize the neighborhood. I'm not even comfortable letting my 5 and 2 year old go play in the courtyard even with supervision due to these children's lack of respect and common decency. The mob of children is another thing that the management does not take seriously.\\n   There was formerly a top notch maintenance team that went way past the call of just doing their jobs that was attentive, responsible, and consistent. Now the maintenance team does as little as possible on a daily basis and seems to never have any appropriate response time to any issues.\\n   When it comes to even dealing with any bit of business that you may have there is an 80% chance that you will be dealing with Yesenia the assistant manager. Not only does Yesenia have one of the most abrasive and aggressive attitudes I've ever come across, however it is also clear that she looks down upon tenants. The staff that is currently there takes a posture with all tenants as if they're are entering a knock down, drag out fight and leaves you feeling as if you're communicating with the principal of a school as opposed to actually doing adult business with a company. The leasing agents also have absolutely NO liberty to make any decision and you are wasting your time speaking with them in any regard other than getting packages, but barely even that.\\n   This is the only bad experience I've ever been compelled to leave a Yelp review about, let alone a negative one. I originally came to this place because I had my eyes on it for years and was impressed by their consistent delightful presence and what appeared to be a pleasant place to live. I was even quite impressed, then all hell broke lose. I really would hate for any young couple, or family to have to experience what we have here so far. It is more than worth at this point to pay a $1200 broken lease fee than it would ever possibly be to stay here and waste any more time, energy, and money here. I really hope Mark Taylor actually reads the terrible reviews all around about this place and actually does something about it.</td>\n",
